# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm JD, IT engineering student. Welcome to my Github profile, I will be uploading my personal notes related to my favorite degree subjects as well as some personal projects, the ones made with friends and the ones made at uni & at 42. I will publishing everything once it's done and fully working. Hope it helps you with your code and your goals! Feel free to reach me if you find something wrong or dont't working properly.

These days I will be improving the documentation of many repositories because lots of them are not clear enough.
